VERSIONING POLICY
Atlas Tuning Engine (ATE_Free) v1.0
GhostShell Labs

---

PURPOSE

This document explains how versions of Atlas Tuning Engine are managed, identified, and released.

Versioning exists for:
• Trust
• Transparency
• Predictability
• Rollback safety

If a system update changes behavior, you deserve to know.

---

VERSION FORMAT

ATE uses semantic versioning:

MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

Examples:
1.0.0  
1.1.0  
1.1.1  

---

WHAT EACH NUMBER MEANS

MAJOR  
Large architectural or behavior changes.
Backwards compatibility is not guaranteed.
User review recommended.

MINOR  
Feature additions or non-breaking behavior changes.
Safe for most users.

PATCH  
Bug fixes or documentation updates.
No tuning impact.

---

RELEASE DISCIPLINE

Every release:

• Has a unique version number  
• Is logged in CHANGELOG.txt  
• Is distributed as a complete package  
• Is never silently modified  
• Does not self-update  

GhostShell Labs does not push hidden changes.

---

COMPATIBILITY GUARANTEE

ATE releases are:
• Tested before distribution
• Compatible within a MAJOR line
• Forward-stable unless documented otherwise

Breaking changes always increment MAJOR.

---

ROLLBACK PHILOSOPHY

ATE does not modify past releases.

If you keep a copy of an older version, it remains valid.

Rolling forward is optional.
Rolling back is respected.

---

UPDATE DELIVERY

ATE does not update itself.

Users:
• Download full releases
• Control when to upgrade
• Can skip versions

No forced updates.
No background patching.

---

VERSION VISIBILITY

Version identity is:

• Displayed in the UI
• Included in README
• Logged in engine output
• Recorded in CHANGELOG.txt

No anonymous builds exist.

---

PRE-RELEASE BUILDS

Beta or early-access versions:
• Are clearly labeled
• May change behavior
• Are intended for testing
• May be unstable

Production builds are explicitly marked Stable.

---

DOWNGRADE POLICY

Downgrading is permitted.

Backward compatibility is preserved within a major version when possible.

---

PATREON CONTEXT

Early builds may be shared through Patreon.

General releases remain public.

Patreon does not override version policy.

There are no private “special builds” that differ in behavior.

---

FINAL NOTE

Versioning is part of user trust.

Silence is not acceptable.
Surprises are not allowed.

---

END OF POLICY

Trust… But Verify.
