CHANGELOG
Atlas Tuning Engine (ATE_Free) v1.0

------------------------------------
2025-11-30 — Documentation Sync & UX Hardening
------------------------------------

Core & UX
- Fixed rank display bug ("System.Object[]" output) so rank now resolves to a clean, human-readable string.
- Normalized score display formatting across the Front Door UI and scorecard output.
- Confirmed InteractiveFrontDoorSession behavior:
  - Persistent Front Door loop in interactive mode.
  - "Press ENTER to close" now only appears for one-shot CLI executions.
- Hardened Front Door flow for repeated mode runs in a single console session.

Splash & UI
- Removed legacy/unused Hide-ATEConsole and Show-ATEConsole stubs from ATE_Splash.
- Verified splash remains cosmetic-only, non-blocking, DPI-aware, and does not alter console state.
- Confirmed splash failures do not prevent engine execution.

Architecture & Pathing
- Enforced canonical directory structure:
  - Engine = code only.
  - Resources = logs, backups, configs, assets.
- Normalized path authority across all modules:
  - ProductRoot
  - EngineRoot
  - ResourcesRoot
  - LogRoot
  - BackupRoot
  - ConfigPath
  - SplashPath
- Removed any implicit or legacy path writes into Engine.
- Locked directory layout as ATE v1.0 golden baseline.

Module Registry & Lock
- Certified final module set and locked as authoritative:
  - ATE_Bootstrap.ps1
  - ATE_Core.ps1
  - ATE_Config.ps1
  - ATE_Logging.ps1
  - ATE_Utils.ps1
  - ATE_System.ps1
  - ATE_Storage.ps1
  - ATE_Network.ps1
  - ATE_GPU.ps1
  - ATE_Audio.ps1
  - ATE_Security.ps1
  - ATE_UI.ps1
  - ATE_Splash.ps1
- Permanently removed ATE_Console.ps1 from production architecture.
- Confirmed no runtime dependency on internal tools.

Documentation & Compliance
- Rebuilt README in official GhostShell Labs voice.
- Added explicit:
  - Safety philosophy
  - Privacy statement (no telemetry / no network calls)
  - Patreon disclaimer
  - Support boundaries
  - System requirements
  - Restore expectations
- Replaced custom stub license with fully structured proprietary license.

  - Explicit non-commercial clause
  - Anti-redistribution controls

  - Indemnification clause
  - Patent-rights exclusion
  - Governing law: State of Alabama, USA
- Generated:
  - ArchitectureOverview.txt
  - LegalAndDisclaimer.txt
- Synchronized documentation against README + LICENSE + architecture doctrine.
- Enforced ATE Documentation Sync Rule v1.0 compliance.

Release Integrity
- Locked ATE_Free v1.0 as release-candidate baseline.
- Confirmed:
  - Identity section certified complete
  - Trust and safety pillars certified complete
  - Versioning discipline enforced
- Deviations from certified baseline now require Commander approval.
