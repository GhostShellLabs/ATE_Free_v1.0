FRONT DOOR UX DOCTRINE
Version: 1.0
Status: Baseline Locked
Date: 2025-12-01
Governed By: Master_Release_Plan_v1.0.txt

Purpose:
Defines the user experience expectations and invariants for the ATE_Free Front Door interface.

Interactive Mode (No CLI switches):
- A persistent Front Door menu is presented.
- User may run one or more tuning modules in sequence.
- Upon completion of a module, control returns to the Front Door menu.
- Exit option cleanly terminates the session.

CLI One-Shot Mode (With switches):
- ATE runs the specified operations once and exits.
- No Front Door menu is presented.
- No blocking “Press ENTER to exit” prompt in scripted/automation scenarios.

Splash Behavior:
- Splash window is cosmetic-only and must not block or control console lifetime.
- Failure to load splash must not abort engine execution.

UX Invariants:
- Errors should be logged and surfaced clearly; no silent failures.
- UX behavior should remain consistent across releases unless explicitly documented and versioned.

Changelog:
- 2025-12-01 – Front Door UX Doctrine v1.0 locked for ATE_Free v1.0.
