  Allowed Dependencies: None (pure utility).

- ATE_System.ps1
  Responsibility: OS and system-level tuning (e.g., services, power plans) per safety doctrine.
  Allowed Dependencies: ATE_Config, ATE_Logging, ATE_Utils.

- ATE_Storage.ps1

  Allowed Dependencies: ATE_Config, ATE_Logging, ATE_Utils.

- ATE_Audio.ps1
  Responsibility: Audio stack checks and safe adjustments only.
  Allowed Dependencies: ATE_Config, ATE_Logging, ATE_Utils.

Deprecated / Forbidden Modules:
- ATE_Console.ps1 — Removed from architecture; must not be reintroduced without explicit Commander approval and full document updates.

Module Governance Rules:
- Any new module, or removal/rename of an existing module, requires:
  - Commander approval.
  - Updates to MMRL, AMDD, and Master Release Plan.
- Cross-module dependencies must remain within the constraints defined here and in AMDD.
