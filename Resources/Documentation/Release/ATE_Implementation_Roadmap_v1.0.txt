ATE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP
Version: 1.0
Status: Baseline Locked
Date: 2025-12-01
Governed By: Master_Release_Plan_v1.0.txt

Purpose:
Defines the phased implementation path for ATE_Free and clearly separates v1.0 scope from future work.

Phase 1 — Modular Baseline (COMPLETED FOR v1.0):
- Extract ATE core logic into modular PowerShell scripts.
- Establish Engine/Resources directory structure.
- Implement Front Door interactive UX and CLI one-shot mode.
- Wire ATE_Bootstrap and ATE_Core to use ATE_Config, ATE_Logging, and ATE_Utils.
- Ensure non-destructive defaults and safety doctrine are respected.
- Lock module list and directory structure.
- Produce baseline documentation and certification for ATE_Free v1.0.

Phase 2 — Post-v1.0 Enhancements (NOT IN v1.0):
- Extended UX improvements, wizards, or presets.
- Pro-tier or advanced tuning modules.
- Additional automation and heuristic-based recommendations.
- Deeper integration with external tools (if approved by Commander).

Roadmap Rules:
- v1.0 releases may only contain Phase 1 features and behaviors.
- Phase 2 items and beyond must not be included in v1.0 without explicit revision of this roadmap and Master Release Plan.
- Future roadmap versions (v1.1+) may extend or adjust phases but must remain explicit about release scope.

Changelog:
- 2025-12-01 – Phase 1 marked complete; roadmap v1.0 locked for ATE_Free v1.0.
