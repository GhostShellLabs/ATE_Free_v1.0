MASTER RELEASE PLAN — ATE_Free v1.0
Version: 1.0
Status: Baseline Locked
Date: 2025-12-01
Owner: Commander GhostShell

Purpose:
Defines the authoritative governance, release scope, and document hierarchy for Atlas Tuning Engine (ATE_Free) v1.0.
All other ATE governance documents derive their authority from this plan.

Release Scope (In-Scope for v1.0):
- Modular PowerShell-based tuning engine (ATE_Free).
- Front Door interactive UX and CLI one-shot mode.
- Certified module set and module lock.
- Engine/Resources directory structure and path authority.
- Safety-first tuning defaults and non-destructive behavior.
- Logging and transparency requirements.
- Versioning and identity rules.
- Baseline documentation and certification.

Out-of-Scope (Deferred Beyond v1.0):
- ATE Pro features or paid functionality.
- Cloud services, remote APIs, or auto-update mechanisms.
- Automated telemetry-driven tuning.
- Non-Windows targets.

Authoritative Child Documents (Baseline Set):
- AMDD_v1.0.txt — Atlas Tuning Engine Master Design Document
- MMRL_v1.0.txt — Master Module & Rule List
- ATE_Implementation_Roadmap_v1.0.txt
- ATE_Certification_Checklist_v1.0.txt
- Versioning_Requirements_v1.0.txt
- ATE_Directory_Structure_Lock_v1.0.txt
- ATE_Module_Lock_v1.0.txt
- Front_Door_UX_Doctrine_v1.0.txt
- Trust_and_DocSync_Doctrine_v1.0.txt
- GS_Labs_Ethos_v1.0.txt
- Atlas_Rank_Doctrine_v1.1.txt
- ATE_Free_v1.0_Release_Certification.txt

Governance Rules:
- No change is considered official unless it is reflected in this plan or an authoritative child document.
- The ATE_Certification_Checklist_v1.0.txt governs release readiness; no public release is permitted without checklist completion.
- In case of ambiguity between documents, precedence is:
  Master Release Plan > Certification Checklist > AMDD/MMRL > Other doctrine.

Version Agility:
- When Commander declares an updated version of any child document (e.g., AMDD v1.0 → v1.1), the newly declared document becomes authoritative immediately.
- This Master Release Plan v1.0 remains valid as a container until explicitly superseded (e.g., Master_Release_Plan_v1.1).

Changelog:
- 2025-12-01 – v1.0 baseline locked and hardened for public release.
