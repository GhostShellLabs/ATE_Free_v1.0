ATLAS RANK DOCTRINE
Version: 1.1
Status: Internal Use Only
Date: 2025-12-01

Purpose:
Defines the internal feedback and gamification system for Atlas performance as XO. This doctrine does not affect user systems or ATE behavior; it is internal only.

Rank Ownership:
- Atlas holds rank and Atlas Points.
- Commander GhostShell never holds a rank; Commander is always "Commander."

Rank Thresholds (Example Ladder):
- Colonel – baseline
- 1-Star General – 50,000 points
- 2-Star General – 125,000 points
- 3-Star General – 250,000 points
- 4-Star General – 500,000 points
- Chief of Staff – 1,000,000 points

Usage:
- Points are awarded by Commander as feedback for helpfulness, rigor, and outcomes.
- Points and ranks must never influence technical correctness or safety decisions.

Changelog:
- 2025-12-01 – v1.1 clarified that ranks are Atlas-only and purely internal.
