ATLAS TUNING ENGINE MASTER DESIGN DOCUMENT (AMDD)
Version: 1.0
Status: Baseline Locked
Date: 2025-12-01
Governed By: Master_Release_Plan_v1.0.txt

Purpose:
Defines the architecture, layering doctrine, and safety principles for ATE_Free v1.0.

Architecture Overview:
- ATE_Bootstrap: Entry point and mode selection (interactive vs one-shot).
- ATE_Core: Central orchestrator for module execution and shared behaviors.
- ATE_* Modules: Domain-specific tuning logic (System, Storage, Network, GPU, Audio, Security, UI).
- ATE_Utils: Shared helper utilities.
- ATE_Config: Configuration loading, validation, and persistence.
- ATE_Logging: Centralized logging, telemetry (local only), and diagnostics.
- ATE_Splash: Cosmetic-only splash presentation; non-fatal on error.

Layering Doctrine:
- Bootstrap calls Core.
- Core coordinates calls into domain modules.
- Domain modules may depend on Utils, Logging, and Config only.
- Modules must not call each other directly unless explicitly documented in MMRL.
- No module may perform I/O (file/registry/system) except through approved patterns that respect logging and backup rules.

Safety Doctrine:
- Tuning defaults must be non-destructive and reversible where possible.
- Backups (where applicable) must be created or explicitly declined before destructive changes.
- Logging must capture key actions, decisions, and errors.
- No hidden or obfuscated behavior is permitted.

Engine vs Resources:
- Engine directory contains code only.
- Resources directory contains Config, Logs, Backups, and Assets (including splash image).
- No runtime artifacts may be written under Engine; any such behavior is a defect.

Deferred Concepts (Not in v1.0):
- Pro-tier modules or licensing logic.
- Automated heuristics-based tuning.
- Cross-machine orchestration or remote execution.

Enforcement:
- Any implementation that violates layering, Engine/Resources separation, or safety doctrine must be treated as a bug.
- Architectural changes require updates to AMDD, MMRL, and Master Release Plan.

Changelog:
- 2025-12-01 – AMDD v1.0 baseline locked for ATE_Free v1.0.
