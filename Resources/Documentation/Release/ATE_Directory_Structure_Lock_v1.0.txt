ATE DIRECTORY STRUCTURE LOCK
Version: 1.0
Status: Baseline Locked
Date: 2025-12-01
Governed By: Master_Release_Plan_v1.0.txt and AMDD_v1.0.txt

Purpose:
Enforces the canonical directory structure and path authority for ATE_Free v1.0.

Canonical Structure:
- Engine\  → All ATE PowerShell scripts and orchestration code (no runtime artifacts).
- Resources\
    Config\   → Configuration files (e.g., ATE_Config.json).
    Logs\     → Log and diagnostic output.
    Backups\  → Backup data produced by the engine.
    Assets\Splash\ → Splash/branding assets (e.g., ATE_Splash.png).

Rules:
- Engine MUST NOT contain logs, backups, config, or runtime-generated files.
- Resources is the single canonical home for all runtime artifacts.
- Any new top-level directory must be explicitly documented and approved.

Defect Definition:
- Any runtime write into Engine is considered a defect and must be corrected.
- Any relocation of Config, Logs, or Backups outside Resources requires document updates.

Changelog:
- 2025-12-01 – Directory Structure Lock v1.0 established for ATE_Free v1.0.
