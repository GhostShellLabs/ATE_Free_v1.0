TRUST & DOCUMENTATION SYNC DOCTRINE
Version: 1.0
Status: Baseline Locked
Date: 2025-12-01
Governed By: Master_Release_Plan_v1.0.txt and GS_Labs_Ethos_v1.0.txt

Purpose:
Defines how GhostShell Labs enforces safety, transparency, and documentation accuracy for ATE_Free v1.0.

Trust Principles:
- No black-box behavior: users should be able to understand what ATE does.
- No silent changes: impactful tuning actions should be logged and described.
- No hidden monetization: ATE_Free v1.0 does not include paid unlock logic.

Safety Principles:
- Prefer non-destructive defaults.
- Require explicit user consent for higher-risk changes.
- Encourage backups and rollback options where practical.

Documentation Sync:
- Any change in behavior, architecture, or scope should trigger documentation evaluation.
- At minimum, README, CHANGELOG, and relevant doctrine docs must be updated to reflect new reality.
- Behavior that diverges from documentation is considered a bug.

Changelog:
- 2025-12-01 – Trust & Documentation Sync Doctrine v1.0 locked for ATE_Free v1.0.
