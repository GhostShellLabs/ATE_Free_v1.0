PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT

This document exists to explain how Atlas Tuning Engine is structured internally so you understand:
• What runs on your system
• How it is organized
• What each part does
• Why it is built conservatively
• Where risk is intentionally avoided

You do not need to understand every module to use ATE safely.

This document exists for transparency, not requirement.

---

SAFETY SUMMARY (READ FIRST)

• No module installs software  
• No module runs persistently  
• No module connects to the internet  
• No module hides system writes  
• All actions are logged  
• Restore capability is built in  

ATE does not operate silently.

---

OVERVIEW

Atlas Tuning Engine (ATE_Free) is a modular Windows tuning engine designed to inspect system configuration, surface performance friction points, and apply conservative optimizations when the user explicitly allows it.

ATE is designed to favor:
• Predictability
• Auditability
• Reversibility
• Minimal disruption

ATE focuses on correcting configuration and reducing known inefficiencies — not imposing unsafe performance hacks.

---

CORE ARCHITECTURE

ATE enforces strict separation between code and data.

ENGINE  
Contains all logic, orchestration, validation, and tuning rules.

RESOURCES  
Contains logs, backups, configuration files, and assets produced at runtime.

This design prevents invisible state.
Nothing is hidden.
Nothing moves arbitrarily.

ATE runs entirely locally.
No cloud services are used.
No external agents are required.

---

MODULE SYSTEM

ATE is composed of independent modules.

Each module:
• Has a narrow, defined scope
• Does not depend directly on other domain modules
• Reports through centralized logging
• Reads configuration through a single authority
• Cannot affect unrelated areas

If one module fails, it does not destabilize the engine.

This is intentional.

MODULE DESCRIPTIONS

----------------------------------------
ATE_Bootstrap.ps1
----------------------------------------
ROLE
Engine entry point. Prepares environment, validates prerequisites, and loads the core runtime.

COMMUNICATION
Uses Config, Logging, and Utilities to initialize state.

ENTRY POINT
Executed directly by user or via ATE_Launcher.bat.

----------------------------------------
ATE_Core.ps1
----------------------------------------
ROLE
Central orchestrator. Owns menus, modes, and module execution order.

COMMUNICATION
Invokes all domain modules. Reads config and writes logs centrally.

ENTRY POINT
Called by ATE_Bootstrap after environment setup.

----------------------------------------
ATE_Config.ps1
----------------------------------------
ROLE
Configuration authority. Loads policy data and default behavior rules.

COMMUNICATION
Provides values to all modules.

ENTRY POINT
Called by ATE_Core and any domain module needing configuration data.

----------------------------------------
ATE_Logging.ps1
----------------------------------------
ROLE
Central logging engine. Writes diagnostics and summaries.

COMMUNICATION
Receives events from all modules.

ENTRY POINT
Used universally across the engine.

----------------------------------------
ATE_Utils.ps1
----------------------------------------
ROLE
Shared utilities and helper functions.

COMMUNICATION
Supports all modules with reusable logic.

ENTRY POINT
Called internally wherever helper logic is required.

----------------------------------------
ATE_System.ps1
----------------------------------------
ROLE
OS-level optimization and configuration alignment.

COMMUNICATION
Uses Config for policy, Logging for visibility, Utils for safe system interaction.

ENTRY POINT
Invoked by Core during system tuning phase.

----------------------------------------
ATE_Storage.ps1
----------------------------------------
ROLE
Storage inspection and configuration behavior tuning.

COMMUNICATION
Reports diagnostics through Logging.

ENTRY POINT
Invoked by Core during storage phase.

----------------------------------------
ATE_Network.ps1
----------------------------------------
ROLE
Network tuning and diagnostics.

COMMUNICATION
Reads config flags, reports findings.

ENTRY POINT
Invoked by Core during network phase.

----------------------------------------
ATE_GPU.ps1
----------------------------------------
ROLE
Windows-side GPU configuration only.

COMMUNICATION
Restrained to OS settings — not hardware.

ENTRY POINT
Invoked by Core during GPU phase.

----------------------------------------
ATE_Audio.ps1
----------------------------------------
ROLE
Audio behavior optimization without touching drivers or hardware.

COMMUNICATION
Uses registry and service awareness only.

ENTRY POINT
Invoked by Core during audio phase.

----------------------------------------
ATE_Security.ps1
----------------------------------------
ROLE
Security-impact configuration review with safety-first defaults.

COMMUNICATION
Uses cautious policy enforcement and logs every action.

ENTRY POINT
Invoked by Core where security evaluation is enabled.

----------------------------------------
ATE_UI.ps1
----------------------------------------
ROLE
Console clarity and presentation.

COMMUNICATION
Formatting only; does not tune systems.

ENTRY POINT
Called by Core for output rendering.

----------------------------------------
ATE_Splash.ps1
----------------------------------------
ROLE
Optional visual splash.

COMMUNICATION
Zero functional interaction.

ENTRY POINT
Invoked during startup if enabled.

CONFIGURATION & STATE

ATE uses centralized configuration files stored under Resources.

No tuning values are buried inside code.

If configuration is absent:
• Safe defaults apply  
• Behavior degrades safely  

---

LOGGING & TRANSPARENCY

Every operation produces logs.

Logs are human-readable.
Logs are never suppressed.
Logs explain success and failure.

The engine refuses silent failure.

---

WHAT HAPPENS IF A MODULE FAILS

Module failure:

• Does NOT crash the engine  
• Does NOT cascade  
• Is logged  
• Is visible  

ATE favors loud failure over hidden failure.

---

SYSTEM BOUNDARIES

ATE will never:

• Modify BIOS  
• Flash firmware  
• Touch bootloaders  
• Encrypted volumes  
• Replace drivers  
• Install services  
• Run background agents  
• Access networks  
• Upload data  
• Operate silently  

---

VERSION CONTROL

ATE enforces release discipline.

Each build:
• Has version identity  
• Tracks changes  
• Refuses silent mutation  
• Preserves rollback logic

No self-updates exist.

---

USER TRUST MODEL

ATE assumes:
• Stability matters
• Undo matters
• Visibility matters

Aggression is not optimization.

Conservative engineering is.

---

PATREON TRANSPARENCY

ATE_Free is free.

Patreon:
• Does not unlock features
• Does not sell behavior
• Does not change execution
• Does not sell access

Patreon funds development, documentation, and testing.

The engine remains identical for everyone.

SUPPORT CONTEXT
