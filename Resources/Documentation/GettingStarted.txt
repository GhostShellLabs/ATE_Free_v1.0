GETTING STARTED
Atlas Tuning Engine (ATE_Free) v1.0
GhostShell Labs

---

WELCOME

Atlas Tuning Engine is designed to be safe, readable, and predictable.

This document walks you through your first safe run.

Nothing here is complicated.
Nothing here is rushed.
Nothing happens without your approval.

---

STEP 1 — EXTRACT SAFELY

Extract the entire ATE_Free folder to a normal location such as:

Desktop
Documents
A secondary drive

Do NOT run directly from a ZIP file.  
Do NOT place inside Program Files.

ATE is a portable tool. It should live in a folder you control.

---

STEP 2 — LAUNCH

Run one of the following:

ATE_Launcher.bat  
ATE_Bootstrap.ps1  

If prompted, allow administrator privileges.  
This gives ATE permission to inspect system configuration.

Nothing is changed at launch.

---

STEP 3 — READ-ONLY FIRST (MANDATORY)

Always begin with Read-Only mode.

This does NOT change anything.

It scans:
• System configuration
• Performance-impacting services
• Policy alignment
• Known friction points

Think of this as diagnostics — not tuning.

---

STEP 4 — REVIEW RESULTS

After the scan:

Open:
Resources\Logs

You will find:
• Summary report
• Detailed logs
• Detected issues

Read the output.

ATE never hides what it finds.

This phase is about understanding your system before touching it.

---

STEP 5 — APPLY ONLY IF COMFORTABLE

If — and only if — you agree with the recommendations:

Choose Apply Mode.

ATE will:
• Confirm actions
• Log each change
• Track success and failures

Nothing is done silently.
Nothing happens without visibility.

---

STEP 6 — VERIFY

After applying:

Run Read-Only again.
Compare logs.
Confirm change behavior.

This is how you validate the system.

---

RESTORE IF NEEDED

If something does not feel right:

Use Restore mode.

ATE stores backups in:
Resources\Backups

Restoring is part of the design.

ATE never assumes perfection.
Neither should you.

---

IMPORTANT WARNINGS

• Do NOT run on PowerShell 7+  
• Do NOT use on Windows Server  
• Do NOT expect miracles  
• Do NOT ignore logs  
• Do NOT apply blindly  

ATE favors correctness, not speed.

---

COMMON QUESTIONS

Q: Is it safe to run multiple times?
Yes. ATE is idempotent where applicable.

Q: Does it change hardware?
No.

Q: Does it install anything?
No.

Q: Does it stay running?
No.

Q: Do I need internet?
No.

---

GOOD PRACTICES

• Read logs  
• Apply changes gradually  
• Reboot if prompted  
• Validate results  
• Restore if unsure  

ATE is not a game cheat.
It’s engineering.

---

YOU ARE DONE

There is no subscription.
No remote connection.
No service running.
No background process.

The engine completes and exits.

You’re in control.

Trust… But Verify.
