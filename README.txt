WHAT ATE IS
============================================================
ATE_Free is a conservative Windows tuning engine for gamers who want
measurable system improvements without compromising stability or safety.

ATE_Free operates on three core principles:
Predictable behavior.
Auditable execution.
Reversible change.

No hidden actions.
No undocumented behavior.
No firmware meddling.
No silent modification.

============================================================
WHAT ATE IS NOT
============================================================
ATE is NOT:
- A registry wipe tool
- A “one-click FPS booster”
- A BIOS or firmware modifier
- Bloatware or telemetry software
- An antivirus replacement
- A promise of guaranteed performance gains

If a tool relies on mystery, ATE does not use it.

============================================================
